# IB Computer Science 2027
{: .no_toc }

{: .highlight }
For the new IB Diploma Computer Science syllabus to start teaching in August 2025, and for first examinations in May 2027.

{: .important }
Content will be updated gradually as developed in preparation for teaching the new course in August.

## Internal assessment

The new Internal Assessment criteria are as follows:

| Criterion | Deliverables | Word count |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Criteria A | Scenario / context / success criteria | 300 words |
| Criteria B | Planning overview (eg: GANTT) | 150 words plus diagrams |
| Criteria C | System overview (design diagrams as relevant, such as UML, flowcharts, network diagrams, system design diagrams, UX navigation charts, etc) | 150 words plus diagrams |
| Criteria D | Development document discussing algorithms used | 1000 words |
| Criteria D | Demonstration video | 5 minute video |
| Criteria E | Evaluation and recommendations | 400 words |

For those familar with the Internal Assessment of the old syllabus, the following are some noteworthy changes:

* Students no longer require a client; They are producing the IA for themselves now.  This is a positive move as there was always a tension between client needs and what the student needed from a project for their assessment. Now, students can select a project that both (a) interests them and (b) allows them to best showcase their algorithmic talnet.

* The overall size and scope of the IA is roughly comparable to the old course. I anticipate my students still requiring considerable "at home" hours to complete the IA.

* New criteria D is focused on students discussing their techniques used, with a specific focus on algorithms. While similar to the old criteria C, it is more explicit that the focus is algorithms which should help make the expectations clearer.
