## Artificial Intelligence in the Computer Science IA

The Computer Science Internal Assessment is no different than any other IB assessment. 

It is subject to the same Academic Integrity Policy as everything else, including Appendix 6: Guidance on the use of artificial intelligence tools (2023). 

It states: _...students need to be aware that the IB does not regard any work produced—even only in part—by such tools to be their own. Therefore, as with any quote or material from another source, it must be clear that any AI-generated text, image or graph included in a piece of work has been copied from such software. The software must be credited in the body of the text and appropriately referenced in the bibliography. If this is not done, the student would be misrepresenting content—as it was not originally written by them—which is a form of academic misconduct_.

**Does this mean I can use LLM generated programming code in my IA?**

That's the same as asking: _Can you use code sourced from Google, Stackoverflow, or Github?_ Sure! If it is approproiately referenced, you can use _some_ externally sourced code. Would you want your entire IA to be code from these sources? No! 

Externally sourced code, properly cited and in moderation, is perfectly fine and expected. That said, the vast majority of the programming code should be your own independently produced work. The IA is an opportunity for you to showcase your personal programming expertise, not your ability to copy-and-paste someone elses code.

**TL;DR...**: AI tools can be used and are treated the same as any other resource that students may use. They should be fully and properly cited and referenced at all times, failure to do so risks breaching the Academic Integrity Policy.
