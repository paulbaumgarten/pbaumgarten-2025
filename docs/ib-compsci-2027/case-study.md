## Marking criteria for the essay question

A top band response requires:

* Detailed knowledge and clear understanding of the relevant issues and/or concepts. 
* Uses terminology appropriately throughout. 
* Competent and balanced _(infers comparison)_ analysis. 
* Conclusions are drawn that are linked to the analysis. 
* Clear evidence that extensive research has been undertaken.
 
Note: When seeking to demonstrate research by refering to an academic paper or other document, a common question is how much information needs to be memorised? No, you are not expected to give formal citations. My rule of thumb is: Have you provided enough information that I could find the paper/article if I wanted to? This probably means two out of the three of title/author/year.
