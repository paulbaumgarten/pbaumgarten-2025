# B2 problems set 1

These problems are designed as recap exercises for those who have previously, successfully completed IGCSE Computer Science. They assume understanding of the following standards:

* B2.1.1 Construct and trace programs using a range of global and local variables of various data types.
* B2.1.2 Construct programs that can extract and manipulate substrings.
* B2.2.2 Construct programs that apply arrays and Lists.
* B2.3.1 Construct programs that implement the correct sequence of code instructions to meet program objectives.
* B2.3.2 Construct programs utilizing appropriate selection structures.
* B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures to perform repeated actions.
* B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization.

## Puzzle 1: Temperature Tracker

Given a file containing daily temperature readings (one per line), calculate:

* The average temperature.
* The highest and lowest temperatures.
* The number of days when the temperature increased compared to the previous day.

Input: 
* [hk-temperatures-2024.txt](hk-temperatures-2024.txt)

Function name:
* `temerature_tracker()`

Return 4 integers:
* Average temperature, rounded to nearest integer
* Highest temperature, rounded to nearest integer
* Lowest temperature, rounded to nearest integer
* Number of days when the temperature increased compared to the previous day

## Puzzle 2: Spell checker

Given a text document (mystery.txt) and a dictionary of valid words, determine how many words in the mystery document have been spelt correctly. Ignore casing and punctuation. 

Input:
* [mystery-text.txt](mystery-text.txt) (story generated by LLM)
* [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt)

Function name:
* `spell_check()`

Return value:
* Return an integer being the number of correctly spelt words.


## Puzzle 3: Maze Navigator

Read a text file representing a grid (2D list) where:

* `.` is open space
* `#` is a wall
* `S` is the start
* `E` is the end

Write a program to find the shortest path from S to E using only up/down/left/right moves. Note: If you know recursion, avoid using it, just simulate movement with loops.

Input:
* [maze-navigator.txt](maze-navigator.txt)

Function name:
* `maze_navigator()`

Return value:
* An integer, being the number of steps taken to solve the maze (the starting location is 0, and you must step into the end location).

## Puzzle 4: Frequency Counter

Read a list of words and count how many times each word appears. Return a list of results being the same list of words in descending order of frequency. (Ignoring case and punctuation)

Input:
* [frequency-counter.txt](frequency-counter.txt)

Function name:
* `frequency_counter()`

Return value:
* A list of strings, being the words in descending order of frequency.

## Puzzle 5: Robot Instructions

A robot starts at position (0, 0) on a 2D grid. A file contains instructions like:

```
UP 5
LEFT 3
DOWN 2
RIGHT 4
```

Determine the robotâ€™s final position and total distance traveled.

Input:
* [robot-instructions.txt](instructions.txt)

Function name: 
* `robot_instructions()`

Return value:
* Three values, being the `X` coordinate, `Y` coordinate, and `TOTAL_DISTANCE_TRAVELLED`
