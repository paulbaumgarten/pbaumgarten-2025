# B2 problems set 1

These problems are designed as recap exercises for those who have previously, successfully completed IGCSE Computer Science. They assume understanding of the following standards:

* B2.1.1 Construct and trace programs using a range of global and local variables of various data types.
* B2.1.2 Construct programs that can extract and manipulate substrings.
* B2.1.3 Describe how programs use common exception handling techniques.
* B2.1.4 Construct and use common debugging techniques.
* B2.2.2 Construct programs that apply arrays and Lists.
* B2.3.1 Construct programs that implement the correct sequence of code instructions to meet program objectives.
* B2.3.2 Construct programs utilizing appropriate selection structures.
* B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures to perform repeated actions.
* B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization.
* B2.5.1 Construct code to perform file-processing operations.

## Puzzle 1: Temperature Tracker

Given a file containing daily temperature readings (one per line), calculate:

* The average temperature.
* The highest and lowest temperatures.
* The number of days when the temperature increased compared to the previous day.

Input: 

* [hk-temperatures-2024.txt](hk-temperatures-2024.txt)

Skills Practiced: Numeric operations, loops, file I/O, conditionals, functions.

## Puzzle 2: String Scrambler

Given a text document (mystery.txt) and a dictionary of valid words, determine how many words in the mystery document have been spelt correctly. Ignore casing and punctuation. Output the number of correctly spelt words.

Input:

* [mystery-text.txt](mystery-text.txt) (story generated by LLM)
* [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt)

Skills Practiced: String manipulation, file I/O, list processing, functions.

## Puzzle 3: Maze Navigator

Read a text file representing a grid (2D list) where:

* `.` is open space
* `#` is a wall
* `S` is the start
* `E` is the end

Write a program to find the shortest path from S to E using only up/down/left/right moves.

Input:

* [maze-navigator.txt](maze-navigator.txt)

Note: If you know recursion, avoid using it, just simulate movement with loops.

Skills Practiced: 2D lists, loops, conditionals, file I/O.

## Puzzle 4: Frequency Counter

Read a list of words and count how many times each word appears. Output results in descending order of frequency. (Ignore case and punctuation)

Input:

* [frequency-counter.txt](frequency-counter.txt)

Skills Practiced: String manipulation, lists, sorting, file I/O, functions (no dictionaries/hashmaps).

## Puzzle 5: Robot Instructions

A robot starts at position (0, 0) on a 2D grid. A file contains instructions like:

```
UP 5
LEFT 3
DOWN 2
RIGHT 4
```

Determine the robotâ€™s final position and total distance traveled.

Input:
* [robot-instructions.txt](instructions.txt)
