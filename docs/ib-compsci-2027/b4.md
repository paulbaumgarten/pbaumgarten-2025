## Lesson 1: Intro to ADT (HL)

* B4.1.1 Explain the properties and purpose of ADTs in programming.

## Lesson 2,3,4: Linked lists (HL)

* B4.1.2 Evaluate linked lists.
* B4.1.3 Construct and apply linked lists: singly, doubly and circular.

Exercises

2. Hackerrank [Insert a node at the head of a linked list](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-the-head-of-a-linked-list/problem)
3. Hackerrank [Reverse a linked list](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reverse-a-linked-list/problem)
4. Hackerrank [Merge two sorted linked lists](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/problem)
5. Leetcode 83 [Remove duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description/)
6. Hackerrank [Maximum element](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximum-element/problem)
7. Leetcode 141 [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

## Lesson 5,6,7: Binary search trees (HL)

* B4.1.4 Explain the structures and properties of BSTs.

Using a basic binary tree node class as your starting point (such as the one below), add the following methods to your node class.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
    def inorder(self):
        pass # Implement a method to print an in-order traversal
    def preorder(self):
        pass # Implement a method to print a pre-order traversal
    def postorder(self):
        pass # Implement a method to print a post-order traversal
    def insert(self, value):
        pass # Implement a method to perform a BST insertion
    def delete(self, value):
        pass # Implement a method to perform a deletion that maintains BST order

n = Node(42)
```

Exercises

1. Implment the missing methods in the above `Node` class.
2. `find_min()` - Implement a find_min() method that returns the smallest value in a Binary Search Tree.
3. `search(value)` - Implement a search() method that returns True if a given value exists in a Binary Search Tree.
4. Modify `insert()` - Modify the insert() method so as to have an optional parameter, `allow_duplicates` that, when set to `False` will drop (ignore) any attempt to add a value already in the binary tree.
5. `max_depth()` - Return the longest path from the root node to the furthest leaf node. Use it to solve Hackerank [Tree: Height of a Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-height-of-a-binary-tree/problem)
6. `is_in_order()` - Search the contents of the tree and returns `True` if the contents are sorted for _in order_ traversal. Use it to solve Leetcode 98 [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/)
7. `reverse()` - Reverse the order of the binary tree contents. Use it to solve Leetcode 226 [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/)
8. `get_nearest_ancestor(a,b)` - Given two nodes (a and b), find the first parent/grandparent/etc that they have in common and return it. Use it to solve [Binary Search Tree : Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/binary-search-tree-lowest-common-ancestor/problem)
9. Process the input data, placing each value into a binary search tree in the order it is given to you (ie: don't pre-sort the data). Calculate the maximum depth and the maximum width of the resulting binary search tree. Multiply the maximum depth by the maximum width to find your answer value.
