## Criterion A: Problem specification (4 marks)

The problem specification is the starting point of the solution and must be used as a basis for the development of the product.

* The student should have the necessary technical skills, access to appropriate hardware and software, and the availability of relevant data to address the problem. 
* The success criteria identified in the problem specification (assessed by criterion A) will be used in the planning (assessed by criterion B), in the development (assessed by criterion D) and in the evaluation (assessed by criterion E)

The recommended word count for this criterion is 300 words.

| Marks | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
| 1–2 | **Outlines** a problem scenario. <br>**States** limited success criteria. <br>**Outlines** the nature of the solution in a computational context | 
|  3-4 | **Describes** the problem scenario in terms of its measurable solution requirements.<br>**States** appropriate success criteria.<br>**Explains** the choice of computational context for the solution. |

Clarifications

* The **problem scenario** is a clear description of the problem including its measurable solution requirements. The description should relate directly to the problem whether this be in the world around us, other fields of knowledge or a current issue in computing. 
* **Success criteria** are measurable outcomes derived from the solution requirements that indicate the
successful development of the product.
* The **computation context** is the specific area of computing that is selected to be used in the solution. 

## Criterion B: Planning (4 marks)

The planning of the product must be consistent with the problem specification in criterion A. 

* This criterion assesses how the problem scenario has been decomposed into component parts. 
* The plan should address the requirements of the solution, in terms of the success criteria, and include a proposed chronology for the steps involved in planning, designing, developing, testing and evaluating  the solution.
* A plan can be presented in different forms but diagrams such as GANTT and AGILE charts can effectively support the planning process
* The plan may include any relevant research such as the use of existing code libraries. 

The recommended word count for this criterion is 150 words.

| Marks | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
| 1–2 | **Constructs** a partial decomposition of the problem scenario.<br>**Constructs** a plan that addresses some of the success criteria of the solution. |
| 3–4 | **Constructs** a reasonable decomposition of the problem scenario. <br>**Constructs** a plan that addresses the success criteria of the solution. |

Clarifications

* **Decomposition** is the breaking down of the problem scenario identified in criterion A into smaller, more manageable sub-problems or components The decomposition can be effectively constructed using diagrams. 
* A **reasonable decomposition** breaks the problem down into essential components that support the construction of a plan.

## Criterion C: System overview (6 marks)

The system overview of the product must be consistent with the problem specification in criterion A, and the planning in criterion B.

* The system overview should include a system model with the key components, their relationships, the rules governing their interaction and the algorithms required by these components and the user interface.
* The system overview should have the clarity to enable a third party to re-create the product. 
* The system model will provide the information for a viable testing strategy.

The recommended word count for this criterion is 150 words.

| Marks | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
| 1–2 | **Outlines** a limited system model.<br>**Identifies** algorithms for the components of the system model.<br>**Identifies** a testing strategy for at least one success criterion.|
| 3–4 | **Constructs** a system model that is not complete.<br>**Constructs** algorithms for the components of the their model that lead to partial functionality of the product.<br>**Outlines** a testing strategy that aligns with at least three success criteria.|
| 5–6 | **Constructs** a complete system model.<br>**Constructs** algorithms the components of the system model that enable the product to perform<br>**Describes** a testing strategy that aligns with the success criteria. |

Clarifications

* A **system model** consists of diagrams that include the components of the system and how they are connected. The system model will include the design of the User Interface. A **complete system model** does not include the algorithms for each of the components. 
* **Algorithms** can be presented in different forms including natural language, flow charts or pseudocode, and should address the individual components of the system model.
* The **testing strategy** refers to a systematic approach for evaluating whether the computational solution works as intended. The testing strategy should ensure that code functions correctly and handles unexpected or incorrect inputs. This can be represented effectively in a table with proposed test data and expected outcomes.

## Criterion D: Development (12 marks)

The development of the product must be consistent with the problem specification in criterion A, the planning in criterion B and the system overview developed in criterion C.

* The video must provide evidence of the functionality and give examples of the testing of the product.
* The development of the solution must justify the structure of the product, why it is appropriate and demonstrate the techniques used to develop the product based on the algorithms constructed in criterion C.  These techniques may include loops, data structures, existing libraries and the integration of software tools.
* The testing strategy must include testing for correctness, reliability, and efficiency. The testing must be described and justified in the documentation with supporting examples seen in the video.
* The recommended word count for this criterion is 1000 words.

Criterion D assesses the development of the product (12 marks)

| Marks | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0 | The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
| 1–3 | **Constructs** a product with very limited functionality.<br>**Constructs** a product using no appropriate techniques to implement their algorithms.<br>**States** the choices made to implement their algorithm.<br>**States** the testing strategy used. |
| 4-6 | **Constructs** a product that has limited functionality.<br>**Constructs** a product using at least one appropriate technique to implement their algorithms.<br>**Outlines** the choices made to implement their algorithm.<br>**States** the effectiveness of the testing strategy.|
| 7-9 | **Constructs** a product that has partial functionality.<br>**Constructs** a product that uses some appropriate techniques to implement their algorithms.<br>**Explains** the choices made to implement their algorithm.<br>**Describes** the effectiveness of the testing strategy. |
| 10-12 | **Constructs** a fully functional product.<br>**Constructs** a product that uses appropriate techniques to implement their algorithms.<br>**Evaluates** the choices made to implement their algorithm.<br>**Justifies** the effectiveness of the testing strategy.|

Clarifications
* **Implementation and coding of the algorithms**: Techniques in the criteria refer to the process of programming algorithms using code. The documentation must highlight key elements of code that are important for the efficient functioning of the algorithms. Any code presented in the solution must include relevant comments, be consistent and be readable. Code excerpts included in the documentation must be referenced to the full source code submitted as an appendix.
* The video must demonstrate the **functionality** of the product. The deployment of the **testing** strategy and its effectiveness must be described in the documentation with examples of the testing seen in the video.
