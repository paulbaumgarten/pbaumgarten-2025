# Guide to the new IA
{: .no_toc }

{: .highlight }
For the new IB Diploma Computer Science syllabus to start teaching in August 2025, and for first examinations in May 2027.

- TOC

The guide to the IA that I wrote for the previous syllabus was a very popular download. I want to thank all the teachers and students who sent me messages over the years for the encouragement. It's clear that there was a need for such a thorough guide and many people found it very helpful.

With the support of my co-authors, I have developed a new, updated guide for the new Internal Assessment, which has been added as a chapter to the Hachette book, ["Computer Science for the IB Diploma"](https://www.hachettelearning.com/computing-and-it/computer-science-for-the-ib-diploma).

The new IA guide contains a 40 page chapter for the Internal Assessment. For each of the 5 criteria, it includes:

* IB assessment criteria statements
* Top tips
* Common mistakes
* Exemplar samples from real student IA's, re-worked for the new syllabus (separate to the IB authored samples)
* Detailed checklists

Those who found my guide to the IA for the previous syllabus useful, should find the chapter in the Hachette textbook very helpful for navigating the new IA.
