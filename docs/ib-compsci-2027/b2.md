## Lesson 1: Hello world

1. Install VS Code
2. Install Github Desktop
3. Create a Github account
4. Create a Github repo
5. Add me as a collaborator
6. Practice uploading to your Github repo
7. Checking the automated testing

* [python-tests.yml](b2/python-tests.yml)
* [test_helloworld.py](b2/test_helloworld.py)

## Lesson 2-9: IGCSE programming recap 

* B2.1.1 Construct and trace programs using a range of global and local variables of various data types.
* B2.1.2 Construct programs that can extract and manipulate substrings.
* B2.2.2 Construct programs that apply arrays and Lists.
* B2.3.1 Construct programs that implement the correct sequence of code instructions to meet program objectives.
* B2.3.2 Construct programs utilizing appropriate selection structures.
* B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures to perform repeated actions.
* B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization.

Lesson 2 through 9 are a quick recap of programming skills from IGCSE Computer Science. Those confident with their IGCSE programming can do a mini project to refresh their Python and demonstrate their competency with these skills in lieu of the exercises in these lessons.

_B2 problem set 1_ draws on all the programming skills from IGCSE.

Depth first search is an exploration algorithm belonging to the field of graph theory. In this context, A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). DFS is recursive in nature.

For an excellent explainer, see Reducible's video [Depth First Search (DFS) Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMMc4VsIacU)
 
We can use a 2D array to represent a "graph" of interconnected nodes, where each cell in the array is a node, and we can "traverse the graph" by moving to any adjacent cell. That is from `ARR[ 3 ][ 3 ]`, we could traverse to the cell above, below, to the left or to the right, being `ARR[ 2 ][ 3 ]`, `ARR[ 4 ][ 3]`, `ARR[ 3 ][ 2 ]`, and `ARR[ 3 ][ 4 ]` respectively.
