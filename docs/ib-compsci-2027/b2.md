## Lesson 1: Hello world

1. Install VS Code
2. Install Github Desktop
3. Create a Github account
4. Create a Github repo
5. Add me as a collaborator
6. Practice uploading to your Github repo
7. Checking the automated testing

* [python-tests.yml](b2/python-tests.yml)
* [test_helloworld.py](b2/test_helloworld.py)

## Lesson 2-9: IGCSE programming recap 

* B2.1.1 Construct and trace programs using a range of global and local variables of various data types.
* B2.1.2 Construct programs that can extract and manipulate substrings.
* B2.2.2 Construct programs that apply arrays and Lists.
* B2.3.1 Construct programs that implement the correct sequence of code instructions to meet program objectives.
* B2.3.2 Construct programs utilizing appropriate selection structures.
* B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures to perform repeated actions.
* B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization.

Lesson 2 through 9 are a quick recap of programming skills from IGCSE Computer Science. Those confident with their IGCSE programming can do a mini project to refresh their Python and demonstrate their competency with these skills in lieu of the exercises in these lessons.

_B2 problem set 1_ draws on all the programming skills from IGCSE.

If you need to revisit the original IGCSE programming exercises, they are here: [IGCSE Programming 1 problem set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15zfeAWPQe29XuztK5bpKd2JuS_oucqz7mb6g5ZqFPfM/edit)


### Exercise 1: Temperature Tracker
{: .no_toc }

Given a file containing daily temperature readings (one per line), calculate:

* The average temperature.
* The highest and lowest temperatures.
* The number of days when the temperature increased compared to the previous day.

Function name:
* `temerature_tracker()`

Return 4 integers:
* Average temperature, rounded to nearest integer
* Highest temperature, rounded to nearest integer
* Lowest temperature, rounded to nearest integer
* Number of days when the temperature increased compared to the previous day

### Exercise 2: Spell checker
{: .no_toc }

Given a text document (mystery.txt) and a dictionary of valid words, determine how many words in the mystery document have been spelt correctly. Ignore casing and punctuation. 

Input:
* [mystery-text.txt](mystery-text.txt) (story generated by LLM)
* [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt)

Function name:
* `spell_check()`

Return value:
* Return an integer being the number of correctly spelt words.


### Exercise 3: Maze Navigator
{: .no_toc }

Read a text file representing a grid (2D list) where:

* `.` is open space
* `#` is a wall
* `S` is the start
* `E` is the end

Write a program to find the shortest path from S to E using only up/down/left/right moves. Note: If you know recursion, avoid using it, just simulate movement with loops.

Input:
* [maze-navigator.txt](maze-navigator.txt)

Function name:
* `maze_navigator()`

Return value:
* An integer, being the number of steps taken to solve the maze (the starting location is 0, and you must step into the end location).

### Exercise 4: Frequency Counter
{: .no_toc }

Read a list of words and count how many times each word appears. Return a list of results being the same list of words in descending order of frequency. (Ignoring case and punctuation)

Input:
* [frequency-counter.txt](frequency-counter.txt)

Function name:
* `frequency_counter()`

Return value:
* A list of strings, being the words in descending order of frequency.

### Exercise 5: Robot Instructions
{: .no_toc }

A robot starts at position (0, 0) on a 2D grid. A file contains instructions like:

```
UP 5
LEFT 3
DOWN 2
RIGHT 4
```

Determine the robot’s final position and total distance traveled.

Input:
* [robot-instructions.txt](instructions.txt)

Function name: 
* `robot_instructions()`

Return value:
* Three values, being the `X` coordinate, `Y` coordinate, and `TOTAL_DISTANCE_TRAVELLED`

**Quicksort**

**Depth first search**

Depth first search is an exploration algorithm belonging to the field of graph theory. In this context, A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). DFS is recursive in nature.

For an excellent explainer, see Reducible's video [Depth First Search (DFS) Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMMc4VsIacU)
 
We can use a 2D array to represent a "graph" of interconnected nodes, where each cell in the array is a node, and we can "traverse the graph" by moving to any adjacent cell. That is from `ARR[ 3 ][ 3 ]`, we could traverse to the cell above, below, to the left or to the right, being `ARR[ 2 ][ 3 ]`, `ARR[ 4 ][ 3]`, `ARR[ 3 ][ 2 ]`, and `ARR[ 3 ][ 4 ]` respectively.
