## Lesson 1: Hello world

1. Install VS Code
2. Install Github Desktop
3. Create a Github account
4. Create a Github repo
5. Add me as a collaborator
6. Practice uploading to your Github repo
7. Checking the automated testing

* [python-tests.yml](b2/python-tests.yml)
* [test_helloworld.py](b2/test_helloworld.py)

## Lesson 2-9: IGCSE programming recap 

* B2.1.1 Construct and trace programs using a range of global and local variables of various data types.
* B2.1.2 Construct programs that can extract and manipulate substrings.
* B2.2.2 Construct programs that apply arrays and Lists.
* B2.3.1 Construct programs that implement the correct sequence of code instructions to meet program objectives.
* B2.3.2 Construct programs utilizing appropriate selection structures.
* B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures to perform repeated actions.
* B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization.

Lesson 2 through 9 are a quick recap of programming skills from IGCSE Computer Science. Those confident with their IGCSE programming can do a mini project to refresh their Python and demonstrate their competency with these skills in lieu of the exercises in these lessons.

_B2 problem set 1_ draws on all the programming skills from IGCSE.

## Lesson 10: Exception handling & debugging techniques

_Lesson 10 onwards comprises of post-IGCSE content_

B2.1.3 Describe how programs use common exception handling techniques.

* Potential points of failure in a program must include unexpected inputs, resource unavailability, logic errors.
* The role of exception handling in developing programs
* Exception handling constructs that effectively manage errors must include try/catch in Java, and try/except in Python, along with the finally block.

B2.1.4 Construct and use common debugging techniques.

* Debugging techniques may include trace tables, breakpoint debugging, print statements and step-by- step code execution.

## Lesson 11: Stacks

B2.2.1 Compare static and dynamic data structures.

* The fundamental differences between static and dynamic data structures, including their underlying mechanisms for memory allocation and resizing
* The advantages and disadvantages of each type in various scenarios, considering factors such as speed, memory usage, flexibility

B2.2.3 Explain the concept of a stack as a “last in, first out” (LIFO) data structure.

* Must include fundamental operations such as push, pop, peek and isEmpty
* How stack operations impact both performance and memory usage
* An appropriate stack for a specific problem

## Lesson 12: Queues

B2.2.4 Explain the concept of a queue as a “first in, first out” (FIFO) data structure.

* Must include fundamental operations such as enqueue, dequeue, front and isEmpty
* How queue operations impact both performance and memory usage
* An appropriate queue for a specific problem

## Lesson 13: Big O

B2.4.1 Describe the efficiency of specific algorithms by calculating their Big O notation to analyse their scalability.

* The time and space complexities of algorithms and calculating Big O notation
* Algorithm choice based on scalability and efficiency requirements

## Lesson 14,15: Search algorithms

B2.4.2 Construct and trace algorithms to implement a linear search and a binary search for data retrieval.

* The differences in efficiency between different methods of linear and binary search
* Use of search technique based on efficiency requirements—for example, searching a database for a sorted/indexed list of names to find a phone number, versus searching by the number to identify the name

## Lesson 16,17: Sort algorithms

B2.4.3 Construct and trace algorithms to implement bubble sort and selection sort, evaluating their time and space complexities.

* The time and space complexities of each algorithm, denoted by their respective Big O notations
* The advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm in terms of efficiency across various data sets

## Lesson 18,19,20: Recursion (HL)

B2.4.4 Explain the fundamental concept of recursion and its applications in programming. (HL only)

* The fundamentals of recursion and its advantages and limitations
* The utility of recursion in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems
* Recursive algorithms, including but not limited to quicksort
* The limitations of recursion, including complexity and memory usage
* Situations that best suit the use of recursion, including fractal image creation, traversing binary trees, sorting algorithms

B2.4.5 Construct and trace recursive algorithms in a programming language. (HL only)

* Simple, non-branching recursive algorithms in programming only

## Lesson 21: File processing

B2.5.1 Construct code to perform file-processing operations.

* Programs that manipulate text files
* Opening a sequential file in various modes (read, write, append)
* How to read from and write to files, append data to an existing file, and close a file once operations are completed
* Classes for Java users may include Scanner, FileWriter, BufferedReader.
* Functions for Python users may include open(), read(), readline(), write(), close().
