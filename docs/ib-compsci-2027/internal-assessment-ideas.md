The Internal Assessment prioritises the design, construction and use of algorithms. 

Some students struggle to even know what algorithms exist that might be useful for a project. To that end, the following is a list of algorithms commonly learnt at undergraduate level, and their possible uses. I will add to this list over time.

1. Multidimensional Arrays
   * Minesweeper Game (Storing board state, revealing adjacent cells)
