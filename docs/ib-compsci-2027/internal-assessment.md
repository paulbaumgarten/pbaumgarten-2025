# Internal assessment
{: .no_toc }

{: .highlight }
For the new IB Diploma Computer Science syllabus to start teaching in August 2025, and for first examinations in May 2027.

{: .important }
Unit and lesson overviews will be gradually published as developed.

## Overview

The Hachette textbook contains a 40 page guide to the Internal Assessment. For each of the 5 criteria, it includes:

* The official IB assessment criteria text
* Top tips and common mistakes
* Exemplar samples (separate to the IB authored samples)
* Detailed checklist

Those who found my guide to the IA for the previous syllabus useful, should find the chapter in the Hachette textbook very helpful for navigating the new IA. 

The following is my anticipated breakdown of the 35 hours of class time for this IA...

Important note: I am not planning to deliver these lessons as one uninterrupted sequential block. For instance, lesson 1 will be delivered by itself with at least a two week gap before lesson 2 so students can research into their ideas at home before needing to submit a proposal. 

| Lesson | Teaching and learning |

## AI in the Computer Science IA

(this question comes up so often I've decided to give it its own section...)

The Computer Science IA is no different than any other IB assessment. 

It is subject to the same Academic Integrity Policy as everything else, including Appendix 6: Guidance on the use of artificial intelligence tools (2023). It states:

* ... students need to be aware that the IB does not regard any work produced—even only in part—by such tools to be their own. Therefore, as with any quote or material from another source, it must be clear that any AI-generated text, image or graph included in a piece of work has been copied from such software. The software must be credited in the body of the text and appropriately referenced in the bibliography. If this is not done, the student would be misrepresenting content—as it was not originally written by them—which is a form of academic misconduct.

* ... work that is not the student’s own cannot be submitted for assessment.

* If they *(students)* use the text (or any other product) produced by an AI tool—be that by copying or paraphrasing that text or modifying an image—they must clearly reference the AI tool in the body of their work and add it to the bibliography.The in-text citation should contain quotation marks using the referencing style already in use by the school and the citation should also contain the prompt given to the AI tool and the date the AI generated the text.

**Does this mean you can use LLM generated programming code in your IA?**

Let's reframe the question and see how you'd answer it: Can you use Google sourced code, or Stackoverflow code, or code found on Github, in your IA? If it is approproiately referenced, sure, you can use _some_. Would you want your entire IA to be code from these sources? No! 

Externally sourced code in moderation is fine (properly cited), but the vast majority of the programming code should be your own independently produced work. Yes, you are expected to use sources to assist in the development of your IA. No, it shouldn't be most of your IA. 

The assessment of your programming expertise will come from the code you author, not that which comes from an external source.

**TL;DR...**

AI tools can be used and are treated the same as any other resource that students may use: They should be fully and properly cited and referenced at all times, failure to do so risks breaching the Academic Integrity Policy.
