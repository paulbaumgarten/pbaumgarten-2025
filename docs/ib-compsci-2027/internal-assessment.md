## Overview

The Hachette textbook contains a 40 page guide to the Internal Assessment. For each of the 5 criteria, it includes:

* The official IB assessment criteria text
* Top tips and common mistakes
* Exemplar samples (separate to the IB authored samples)
* Detailed checklist

Those who found my guide to the IA for the previous syllabus useful, should find the chapter in the Hachette textbook very helpful for navigating the new IA. 

The following is my anticipated breakdown of the 35 hours of class time for this IA...

Important note: I am not planning to deliver these lessons as one uninterrupted sequential block. For instance, lesson 1 will be delivered by itself with at least a two week gap before lesson 2 so students can research into their ideas at home before needing to submit a proposal.
