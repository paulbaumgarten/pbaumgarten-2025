# IB Computer Science 2027
{: .no_toc }

{: .highlight }
For the new IB Diploma Computer Science syllabus to start teaching in August 2025, and for first examinations in May 2027.

{: .important }
Content will be updated gradually as developed in preparation for teaching the new course in August.

## Samples by IBO

The following are the offical sample IA's published by the IBO for the new course. They have been marked by IB moderators with comments provided but are subject to the following fine-print from the IB:

_Although the examples have been standardized by experienced Diploma Programme (DP) computer science teachers, these example computational solutions, their marks and examiner comments are for guidance only. They are not definitive and have not been generated through the International Baccalaureate's (IB) process of standardization. These examples will be replaced with authentic examination examples following first assessment in 2027._

* Example 1: Birthday card generator (24/30)
* Example 2: Quiz game (17/30)
* Example 3: Chat room (18/30)
* Example 4: Car management system (23/30)
* Example 5: Currency converter (16/30)
* Example 6: IB timetable (26/30)
* Example 7: Trip organizer (22/30)
* Example 8: Flappy bird (13/30)

My students can access them directly via 

* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CxyTGB0coSBCPK8BhCRc1tw03KPekqhD?usp=sharing) (Sha Tin College students only). 

As these materials are IBO copyrighted, I can not share with other teachers and students, so please don't request drive access. IB CompSci teachers can download these for their own classes from the [IBO resource center](https://resources.ibo.org/dp/subject/Computer-science-2027/works/dp_11162-433685?lang=en&root=1.6.2.2.7)

## Past exemplars by STC students

These IA's are from STC students who achieved a 7 on their Internal Assessment (post-moderation).

While based on the old syllabus, the following samples are available and remain quite instructive in a number of ways. When launching the IA with new classes, I will discuss which sections are most relevant and how to obtain value from them.
