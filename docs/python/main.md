# Python notes

This resource has been written to complement instruction by a teacher, not as a stand-alone resource. Descriptions have been kept brief on the basis that detailed explanation of concepts will be delivered through a classroom setting. The resource is intended as a ready reference for students to use as part of their classroom learning.
