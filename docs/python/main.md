This resource has been written to complement instruction by a teacher, not as a stand-alone resource. Descriptions have been kept brief on the basis that detailed explanation of concepts will be delivered through a classroom setting. The resource is intended as a ready reference for students to use as part of their classroom learning.

*Solving problems*

While a larger discussion about Computer Science is beyond the scope of this guide it is important to at least briefly discuss problem solving.

Mastering the art of problem solving can be challenging, particularly for students new to programming. This is because there are many things you are learning simultaneously. You are learning:

•	how to devise algorithms that solve the problem you are working on;
•	how to express your algorithm as programming code; and 
•	how the structure and syntax of the programming language you are using works! All at once!

Trying to achieve all of these things at once is daunting. It is important to establish good habits early so that once you progress beyond the small "getting started" problems you can do in your head, you won't struggle. The most important tip is to stop trying to do it all at once. It is not possible to solve complex problems by sitting down to a computer with a blank screen and just starting to type. 

Complex problems require planning, forethought and a process. As Albert Einstein put it: "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions".

Problem solving is a learned skill like any other. With patience and practice, you can do it!
