## Python from Scratch

By the University of Waterloo

Python from scratch is a gentle introduction to programming, designed with the beginner in mind. No previous background is assumed. Each programming concept is first taught without reference to a specific programming language. Hands-on practice using the programming language of Python helps to reinforce the concepts.
