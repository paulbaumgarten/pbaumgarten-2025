## Programming extension roadmap

The extension roadmap assumes you are already confident in the core skills of IGCSE programming.

As you work through these extension tasks please regularly save your progress into the github repo.  This will help me monitor your progress - check for your understanding, see if you are getting stuck, and monitor pacing (when do I have to add additional items to this doc).

## Competitions

### Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics

Started in 1997, Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (HKOI) is a prestigious annual programming competition for secondary school students, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving and programming skills, and serving as the preliminary selection contest for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) Hong Kong team.

Website: [https://hkoi.org/en/hkoi/](https://hkoi.org/en/hkoi/)

* STC team selection starts in September. Make sure you have registered your interest with me early as we typically have more students wanting to participate than places available (in which case we run a an internal shortlisting test).

### Hong Kong Girls' Olympiad in Infomatics

Hong Kong Girls' Olympiad in Informatics (HKGOI) is an annual programming competition specifically designed for female secondary school students, promoting their participation and excellence in computer science, and serving as the preliminary selection contest for the European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics (EGOI) Hong Kong team.

Website: [https://hkoi.org/en/hkgoi/](https://hkoi.org/en/hkgoi/)

* STC team selection starts in September. Make sure you have registered your interest with me early as we typically have more students wanting to participate than places available (in which case we run a an internal shortlisting test).

### Hong Kong Secondary Schools Coding Challenge

Held in July each year, the HKSSCC is an individual competition in a similar form to the international olympiad informatics (IOI) contest. Cash prizes available.

### Canadian Computing Competition

Canada's version of the HKOI.

Thursday 20 February 2025

The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun challenge for participants with an interest in programming. Designed to be both accessible to participants with some programming experience and to challenge the keenest programmers at the secondary school level, the CCC helps participants build confidence and grow their ability to understand, design, and implement algorithms.  

* [Past contests](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/resources/past-contests?grade=20&academic_year=All&contest_category=29)

### Coding Quest

Monday 3 March to Friday 14 March, 2025 

[https://codingquest.io/](https://codingquest.io/)

Coding Quest is an annual competition specifically for secondary students to showcase their knowledge and understanding of algorithm design, data structures and computational thinking. There are no prizes, just bragging rights. Coding Quest exists mostly for students to compete against themselves. Last year there were 760 students from 97 schools who participated. Previous problems remain open on the website to try.

### Advent of code

For those who are a little nerdy and enjoy pushing your limits with programming, it is a lot of fun - a highlight of the calendar I look forward to every year.

There are 25 days of programming puzzles, 2 each day from 1 December to 25 December. Problems are released at 1:00pm Hong Kong time. 

The puzzles start straight-forward and then get more complex as the days progress. There are no prizes, just bragging rights. I normally don't do the puzzle until the evening, giving you a head-start of a few hours each day to have the chance to beat your teacher that day!

### ESF Co Co

Organized by current ESF students to encourage and influence student interest in computer science from a young age. Renowned Industry leaders and institutes host interactive workshops and deliver informative talks to invoke your interest and passion for technology and computing. Additionally, a large-scale Hackathon will challenge your creativity and innovation.

### NASA Space Apps Challenge

The NASA international SpaceApps challenge is an annual 48 hours hackathon organized by NASA and local hosts around the globe. The challenge addresses the great challenges we are facing on Earth and in space by connecting NASA's data with coders, makers, designers and dreamers around the world. Occurs over 2 days, October 1 & 2, 2022. Registrations in July.
