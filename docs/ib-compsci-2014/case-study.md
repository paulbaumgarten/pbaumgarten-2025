* What are some potential solutions to the challenge? 
* Produce summary documents for the issues and technology for each of the ‘challenges faced’

## Stage 5 - Relevance of the challenges beyond the Case Study

* Research and identify real world examples of this challenge being relevant.
* Produce a document summary of the real life examples and record the citations.

Suggested resources:

* [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)

## Stage 6 - Brainstorm exam questions (question 1,2,3)

* Qu 1, 2 - Definition, outline, describe
* Qu 3 - Explain

## Stage 7 - Brainstorm exam questions (question 4)

* Essay questions based on the challenges

## Stage 8 - Practice essay responses

Review the marking criteria for a top-band response to question 4:

* A response with a detailed knowledge and clear understanding of the relevant issues and/or concepts. 
* A response that uses terminology appropriately throughout. 
* There is competent and balanced (infers comparison) analysis. 
* Conclusions are drawn that are linked to the analysis.
