## Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics - November

Started in 1997, Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (HKOI) is a prestigious annual programming competition for secondary school students, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving and programming skills, and serving as the preliminary selection contest for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) Hong Kong team.

* STC team selection starts in September. Make sure you have registered your interest with me early as we typically have more students wanting to participate than places available (in which case we run a an internal shortlisting test).

## Hong Kong Girls' Olympiad in Infomatics - November

Hong Kong Girls' Olympiad in Informatics (HKGOI) is an annual programming competition specifically designed for female secondary school students, promoting their participation and excellence in computer science, and serving as the preliminary selection contest for the European Girls' Olympiad in Informatics (EGOI) Hong Kong team.

* STC team selection starts in September. Make sure you have registered your interest with me early as we typically have more students wanting to participate than places available (in which case we run a an internal shortlisting test).

## ESF Co Co - Typically November

Organized by current ESF students to encourage and influence student interest in computer science from a young age. Renowned Industry leaders and institutes host interactive workshops and deliver informative talks to invoke your interest and passion for technology and computing. Additionally, a large-scale Hackathon will challenge your creativity and innovation.

## Advent of code - December

For those who are a little nerdy and enjoy pushing your limits with programming, it is a lot of fun - a highlight of the calendar I look forward to every year.

There are 25 days of programming puzzles, 2 each day from 1 December to 25 December. Problems are released at 1:00pm Hong Kong time. 

The puzzles start straight-forward and then get more complex as the days progress. There are no prizes, just bragging rights. I normally don't do the puzzle until the evening, giving you a head-start of a few hours each day to have the chance to beat your teacher that day!
