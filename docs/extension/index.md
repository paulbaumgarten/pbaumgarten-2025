## Competitions & Events

Be sure to check the dedicated page for [competitions & events](events.html) as well.

## Programming extension roadmap

The extension roadmap assumes you are already confident in the core skills of IGCSE programming.

As you work through these extension tasks please regularly save your progress into the github repo.  This will help me monitor your progress - check for your understanding, see if you are getting stuck, and monitor pacing (when do I have to add additional items to this doc).
