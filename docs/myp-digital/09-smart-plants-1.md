| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  | Learning experiences and teaching strategies | Formative assessment | Differentiation |
| 1 | Introduction to unit | Explore the statement of inquiry and key concepts (systems, sustainability). Use think-pair-share to unpack the statement of inquiry:The development of sustainable systems positively improves  the environment Watch short video clips or case studies on social enterprises related to sustainability, urban farming, plant care, or tech-based solutions. Facilitate a **gallery walk** of examples. Discuss how self-watering planters could aid our urban environment (e.g., lack of green space, food insecurity, busy lifestyles). Use a **graphic organizer** for students to brainstorm user needs and community challenges. Students begin defining a target user or community. A.i. explain and justify the need for a solution to a problem for a specified client/target audience |  | Visual examples of existing smart planters |
| 2 | Research & product analysis | Students conduct guided research on: Types of planters (standard, self-watering, smart pots) Materials and features 3D printing constraints Analyse 3 existing products and record comparisons (function, form, innovation, usability).

Set mini challenges (e.g., “Create a hollow cylinder with a 2mm wall thickness”). Create a cylinder with a 2mm wall thickness and 70mm outer diameter *(Shell, basic extrusion, and wall thickness control)* Create a rectangular box that fits a 60 x 30 x 10mm battery. *(Accurate measurement and unit selection)* Sketch a half-profile of a curved pot and revolve it to make a full 3D shape. *(Introduces revolve)* Design a box and separate lid that leave a 0.5mm gap for snapping together. *(Introduces slicing and tolerance planning)* Add a 6mm hole to your battery box to allow a charging cable to pass through *(Subtractive modeling and alignment)* Create a slot or tab to hold a soil moisture sensor (20mm x 5mm). *(Subtract geometry for real-world parts)* Make a small drawer with a matching slot to hold electronics inside a pot base. *(Combines shelling and subtract with fit tolerances)* Add 4 screw holes around the edge of a lid or plate to mock up a mountable cover. *(Precision placement and circular patterns)* |  | Scaffolded through the availability of video walkthroughs for those students that require it. Working in pairs available as an option. |

| 9 | Design the basic pot including overall shape, water tank and how the various components will fit together | Students begin building their final planter design in Shapr3D, based on their approved sketches. Model the outer shell and internal water tank. Explore design options for water flow (e.g., overflow holes, wick channels). Consider how the planter will be assembled (single print, modular designs, snap-fit parts). Use peer modeling reviews: students walk through their design and get feedback. Encourage students to annotate in-app or screenshot \+ annotate in their journals. | Peer modeling reviews: students walk through their design and get feedback | Starter template available for those who wish to use it (students encouraged to create their own) |

Provide scale reference models of the electronics for students to measure. Class discussion about fit tolerances for 3D printing and how to plan for screw holes, clips, or sliding trays. Consider access for maintenance (e.g., removable lid, access door).  |  | Starter template available for those who wish to use it (students encouraged to create their own) |

| 13 | Design the electronics bay within the smart pot, including supports to fit, mount and support each of the required components | **Journaling activity:** ATL: Thinking – Consider ideas from multiple perspectives  “How would someone else use or fix your design? What design changes would help them?” Ask students to "think like" different users: \* The installer (How easy is it to fit the parts?) \* The maker (Will it print without support or errors?) \* The end user (Can they access the electronics if needed?) Sentence starter: “From the perspective of someone replacing the sensor, I realized…” | Self reflection and peer evaluation through journaling activity.  |  |
| 14 | Finalise your designs and prepare to 3d print Finalise ARR | Students inspect their design for: Overhangs or unsupported features Wall thickness Tolerances for assembly Prepare the file for slicing (STL export), and check orientation for printing. Complete pre-flight checklist to ensure the design is ready for 3D printing.  | Pre-flight checklist |  |
| 15 | Finalise your designs and prepare to 3d print | **Journaling activity:** ATL: Self-management – Reflect on and evaluate content learning  Reflection prompts:\* What part of your design shows the biggest improvement from your first sketch? \* What new tool or skill did you use in Shapr3D that changed your design? \* How confident are you in your printability? Students complete a “pre-flight checklist” for final review: \* Are all parts manifold? \* Is the wall thickness appropriate? \* Are overhangs printable? Students identify strengths and areas for improvement in their journal before submitting | Self reflection and peer evaluation through journaling activity.  |  |
