## Rubrics

**Criterion A: Inquiring and Analysing**

**1-2**

- Say what the problem is and why someone might want a better planter. 
- Share a few things you found from your research.

**3-4**

- Explain why someone needs a better planter. 
- Say what you researched and what you still need to find out.
- Describe one product that gave you an idea.
- Write a basic design brief that says what your planter will try to do.

**5-6**

- Give a clear reason why a smart planter is needed for a specific user/group. 
- Plan your research and say what is most important.
- Describe several real products that inspired you.
- Write a clear design brief that explains what you learned.

**7-8**

- Explain and justify the need for your planter. 
- Create a detailed research plan independently.
- Compare products to see what works and what doesn’t.
- Write a detailed design brief that includes analysis.

**Self assessment and peer feedback checklist**
* A.i Clearly explained why someone needs this product, not just what it is* 
* A.i Described a real problem this planter could solve	
* A.ii Created a research plan that includes what I needed to find out and why
* A.ii Prioritized the most important research topics (e.g. planter features, electronics, printing limits)
* A.iii Described at least 3 existing products and what I learned from them
* A.iii Compared what works and doesn’t work in other planters
* A.iv Written a design brief that explains what I learned from research
* A.iv My design brief clearly explains what my design will aim to do

**Criterion B: Developing ideas**

**1-2**
- Write a short list of what your planter should do. 
- Share one sketch or idea.
- Try to draw your final design (may be incomplete).

**3-4**
- Make a longer list of success criteria. 
- Share 2–3 design ideas with notes or labels.
- Say why you chose your final idea.
- Make a basic diagram of your final design.

**5-6**
- Create a clear success criteria list. 
- Share detailed sketches of at least 2–3 design ideas.
- Explain why you chose your final design.
- Make an accurate and labeled diagram.

**7-8**
- Use your research to develop strong success criteria. 
- Share multiple well-labeled design ideas.
- Clearly explain why your final design is best.
- Make a detailed, labeled, and scaled drawing (or CAD model).

**Self assessment and peer feedback checklist**

* B.i Created a clear list of success criteria (what my planter must do)
* B.i Based my success criteria on research and target user needs
* B.ii Sketched at least 2–3 different design ideas
* B.ii Labeled and explained the key features of each idea
* B.iii Chosen one final design and explained why I chose it
* B.iii Used my success criteria to justify my final design
* B.iv Created a detailed and accurate diagram (hand-drawn or Shapr3d)
* B.iv Labeled all key features (e.g. reservoir, electronics space, dimensions)
* B.iv My drawing/diagram could be used to actually build the planter
