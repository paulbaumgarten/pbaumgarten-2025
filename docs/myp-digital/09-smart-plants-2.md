**Criterion C: Creating the solution**

**1-2**
* I showed only a little skill when building or coding my system.
* My system doesn’t work properly or is incomplete.
* I didn’t really plan out my steps.

**3-4**
* I made a plan, but it was missing details or hard to follow.
* I built a basic system that works a little bit, but not fully.
* I used some coding and wiring skills, but had difficulty.
* I briefly said what I changed during the project.

**5-6**
* I created a clear step-by-step plan that most people could follow.
* I used good skills to wire and code my system.
* My system works the way I planned and is put together neatly.
* I explained the changes I made and why I made them.

**7-8**
* I created a well-organized and realistic plan that shows how I used my time and materials efficiently.
* I used excellent skills to build and program my system.
* I followed my plan carefully and built a smart plant pot that works well and looks professional.
* I clearly explained the changes I made as I worked and gave good reasons for them

**Self and peer asseessment checklist**

* I created a clear step-by-step plan for building and coding my smart pot plant.
* My plan includes what I will do, when I will do it, and what materials or tools I’ll need.
* My plan is easy to follow and could be used by someone else to build a similar system.
* I connected the hardware (moisture sensor, pump, ESP32, etc.) correctly and safely.
* I wrote working MicroPython code that controls the system based on sensor readings.
* I tested my system regularly and fixed any technical problems I found.
* I followed my plan closely and made sure my system works as intended.
* My smart pot automatically waters the plant and sends updates to a phone or app.
* I documented any changes I made to my original plan or design.
* I clearly explained why I made those changes and how they helped improve the system.

**Criterion D: Evaluating**

**1-2**
* I described a simple test to check if my system works.
* I said whether my system was successful or not, but didn’t explain much.

**3-4**
* I used a test that gave me useful data (like moisture levels or notifications).
* I compared my results to my original goals and said how successful it was.
* I listed some ways I could improve my system.
* I briefly said how my system might help someone or make a difference.

**5-6**
* I used a few good tests to collect data that showed if my system worked.
* I described in detail how successful it was based on the results.
* I explained some good ideas for how to improve it.
* I described how my system could help the user or the environment.

**7-8**
* I used strong and detailed testing methods that gave accurate results (e.g. moisture logs, watering times, notifications).
* I explained clearly how well my system met the goals using the data.
* I gave thoughtful and realistic suggestions to improve the system.
* I explained how my system could make a positive difference for people and the environment.

**Self and peer asseessment checklist**

* I created a good set of tests to check if my system works as expected.
* I collected useful data from my tests (e.g. sensor readings, watering times, notifications).
* I used my test results to check how well my system met the original goals and design.
* I explained clearly what worked well and what could be better.
* I suggested realistic ways to improve my system (e.g. better design, smarter code, more efficient watering).
* I explained how my smart plant pot helps the user (e.g. saves time, makes plant care easier).
* I explained how my system supports sustainability (e.g. saves water, promotes greenery at home or school).
* I thought about how this type of system could help other people or the environment in the real world
