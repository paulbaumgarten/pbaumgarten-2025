# üå± Planters for Social Enterprise

## üß≠ Unit Overview

**Statement of Inquiry:**  
> *Social entrepreneurs can innovate and influence communities.*

**Key Concept:** Communities  
**Related Concept:** Innovation  
**Global Context:** Fairness and Development (Social Entrepreneurs)  
**Technology Focus:** 3D Modeling with Onshape  

---

## üéØ Project Brief

You will design and 3D print a **self-watering planter** that could be used by someone in your community. Your challenge is to create something **innovative**, **useful**, and **appealing**, guided by the principles of **social enterprise**.

Your final product will:
- Be designed in **Onshape**
- Be 3D printed
- Include testing or simulations of how it functions
- Be evaluated based on **Criterion D**

---

## üìù Assessment: Criterion D - Evaluate

You will **evaluate** your design based on how well it meets your design goals. You will not be able to use it with a live plant yet, so your evaluation will focus on the **design and print quality**, and what you observed during testing.

## üìä Criterion D: Evaluate ‚Äì Task-Specific Rubric

Use this rubric to guide your final evaluation of your 3D-printed planter.  
Focus on how well it meets your design goals and what you learned during testing and printing.

---

### ‚úÖ Level 1‚Äì2 (Limited)

**You:**

- Briefly describe your testing (e.g., ‚ÄúI checked if water stayed in‚Äù).
- State if the planter worked or not, with little detail.
- Do not include much evidence or explanation.

üí° **Example:**  
> ‚ÄúI tested the planter by putting water in it. It printed okay.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ Level 3‚Äì4 (Adequate)

**You:**

- Describe a basic test (e.g., water test, size fit, stability on surface).
- Outline how well the printed planter met some of your design goals.
- List at least one way your design could be improved.
- Briefly explain how your planter could be useful to someone.

üí° **Example:**  
> ‚ÄúI poured 100ml of water into the planter. It held the water, but some leaked.  
> I think I should make the walls thicker. It could help people grow herbs.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ Level 5‚Äì6 (Substantial)

**You:**

- Describe at least one relevant test (e.g., volume capacity, balance, water retention) and share your results.
- Describe the success of your design based on testing and your original success criteria.
- Suggest specific improvements, based on what you observed during testing or printing.
- Describe how your planter design could help people, based on its features and purpose.

üí° **Example:**  
> ‚ÄúI tested the weight and balance. The planter tipped over when filled.  
> It meets the size goal but not stability. I would improve the base width.  
> This planter could help window gardeners grow lettuce with little space.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ Level 7‚Äì8 (Excellent)

**You:**

- Describe detailed and relevant testing methods (e.g., volume tests, stability checks, material strength, peer review) that give accurate data or observations.
- Explain clearly how your planter met or didn‚Äôt meet each success criterion.
- Describe specific, thoughtful improvements, based on your testing, printing process, or peer feedback.
- Explain in detail how your design could impact the user or community, based on its features and design purpose (even if not yet used with a plant).

üí° **Example:**  
> ‚ÄúI tested water capacity (held 220ml, goal was 250ml), and checked that it fits a 6cm plant pot.  
> The print was successful but the walls were too thin. I would increase wall thickness and add a water-fill indicator.  
> The planter is designed to help students grow herbs in dorm rooms with limited time and space.‚Äù
