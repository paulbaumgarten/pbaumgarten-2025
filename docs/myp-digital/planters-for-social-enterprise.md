# üå± Planters for Social Enterprise

## üß≠ Unit Overview

**Statement of Inquiry:**  
> *Social entrepreneurs can innovate and influence communities.*

**Key Concept:** Communities  
**Related Concept:** Innovation  
**Global Context:** Fairness and Development (Social Entrepreneurs)  
**Technology Focus:** 3D Modeling with Onshape  

---

## üéØ Project Brief

You will design and 3D print a **self-watering planter** that could be used by someone in your community. Your challenge is to create something **innovative**, **useful**, and **appealing**, guided by the principles of **social enterprise**.

Your final product will:
- Be designed in **Onshape**
- Be 3D printed
- Include testing or simulations of how it functions
- Be evaluated based on **Criterion D**

---

## üìù Assessment: Criterion D - Evaluate

You will **evaluate** your design based on how well it meets your design goals. You will not be able to use it with a live plant yet, so your evaluation will focus on the **design and print quality**, and what you observed during testing.

### üîç Task-Specific Rubric

| Level | What you need to do |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1‚Äì2** | Describe how you tested your planter (e.g., water test). Say if it worked. |
| **3‚Äì4** | Describe the test and what it showed. Say how well it met your goals. Suggest one improvement. Say who it could help. |
| **5‚Äì6** | Describe useful tests. Explain how well it met each goal. Suggest improvements. Describe how it helps the user. |
| **7‚Äì8** | Describe detailed tests and results. Explain how it met your success criteria. Suggest specific improvements. Describe the real impact on the user or community. |
