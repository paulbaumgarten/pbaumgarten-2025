# Lesson 3: Pre-processing (HL)

---

## Syllabus

A4.2.1 Describe the significance of data cleaning.

* The impact of data quality on model performance
* Techniques for handling outliers, removing or consolidating duplicate data, identifying incorrect data, filtering irrelevant data, transforming improperly formatted data, and imputation, deletion or predictive modelling for missing data
