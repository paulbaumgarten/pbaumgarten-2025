# B3 Object oriented programming
IB Diploma Computer Science

---

# Lesson 1: Introducing OOP

---

## Syllabus

B3.1.1 Evaluate the fundamentals of OOP.

* Model real-world entities using OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
* The advantages and disadvantages of using OOP in various programming scenarios

---

# Lesson 2: Designing classes

---

## Syllabus

B3.1.2 Construct a design of classes, their methods and behaviour.

* Classes and their methods, based on application requirements
* The use of unified modelling language (UML) class diagrams to represent class relationships, attributes and methods, to aid effective software design and planning

---

# Lesson 3: Instantiating objects

---

## Syllabus

B3.1.4 Construct code to define classes and instantiate objects.

* How to define classes and create objects from those classes
* The role of constructors in initializing an object's state, setting initial values for its attributes to define its condition or characteristics at the time of creation

---

# Lesson 4: Encapsulation

---

## Syllabus

B3.1.5 Explain and apply the concepts of encapsulation and information hiding in OOP.

* The principles of encapsulation and information hiding
* Apply access modifiers such as private and public
* Controlling access to class members
* The importance of limiting access to maintain the integrity and security of an object's state

---

# Lesson 5: Statics & non-statics

---

## Syllabus

B3.1.3 Distinguish between static and non-static variables and methods.

* The differences between static and non-static variables and methods, including their usage and scope
* When to use instance variables instead of class variables, and how to apply these concepts effectively in code

---

# Lesson 6,7,8: Programming scenarios

---

## Syllabus

---

# Lesson 9: Inheritance (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B3.2.1 Explain and apply the concept of inheritance in OOP to promote code reusability.

* How inheritance enables a hierarchical relationship between parent and child classes
* Extending existing classes, utilizing inheritance to reuse and extend functionalities
* The impact of inheritance on access to parent class members with different access modifiers (private, public, protected, default)

---

# Lesson 10: Polymorphism (overriding) (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B3.2.2 Construct code to model polymorphism and its various forms, such as method overriding.

* The principle of polymorphism and how it contributes to code flexibility and reusability
* How to implement dynamic polymorphic behaviour through mechanisms like method overriding
* How to apply static polymorphic behaviour to maximize code efficiency

---

# Lesson 11: Abstract classes (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B3.2.3 Explain the concept of abstraction in OOP.

* The significance of abstraction in the development of modular code fragments
* The use of abstract classes to establish common interfaces for sub-classes

---

# Lesson 12: Composition & aggregation (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B3.2.4 Explain the role of composition and aggregation in class relationships.

* How to design objects by leveraging smaller component objects through composition and aggregation
* That aggregation implies that the subcomponents can function independently of the aggregating class, while in composition, the subcomponents are tightly coupled and cannot exist outside the aggregating class

---

# Lesson 13: Design patterns (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B3.2.5 Explain commonly used design patterns in OOP.

* The key design patterns such as singleton, factory and observer
* The application of design patterns in solving recurring programming challenges

---

# Lesson 14-17: Programming scenarios (HL)

---

## Syllabus

---

# Lesson 18,19: Exam style questions

---

## Syllabus

---

# Lesson 20: Assessment

---
