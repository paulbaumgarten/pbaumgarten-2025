# B4 Abstract data types
IB Diploma Computer Science

---

# Lesson 1: Intro to ADT (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B4.1.1 Explain the properties and purpose of ADTs in programming.

* The core principles of ADTs, including their purpose in providing a high-level description of data structures and their associated operations

---

# Lesson 2,3,4: Linked lists (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B4.1.2 Evaluate linked lists.

* Lists must include singly, doubly, circular
* Sketch of linked lists and implementation of basic operations diagrammatically, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, search
* The advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists over other data structures like arrays, particularly in terms of memory utilization and performance

B4.1.3 Construct and apply linked lists: singly, doubly and circular.

* The basic operations on a linked list, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, search

---

# Lesson 5,6,7: Binary search trees (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B4.1.4 Explain the structures and properties of BSTs.

* How binary search trees (BSTs) are used for data organization
* Insert, delete, traverse and searching nodes in a BST
* Sketching a BST as a tree diagram

---

# Lesson 8,9,10: Sets (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B4.1.5 Construct and apply sets as an ADT.

* The fundamental characteristics of sets, including their unordered nature and the uniqueness of elements
* Operations: union, intersection and difference
* Code to check if an element is in a set, to add an element to a set, to remove an element, and to check whether one set is a subset/superset of another set

---

# Lesson 11,12,13: Hashmaps (HL)

---

## Syllabus

B4.1.6 Explain the core principles of ADTs.

* High-level description of data structures and their associated operations and purpose
* The underlying mechanics of hash tables, including hashing functions, collision resolution strategies and load factors
* The underlying mechanics of sets to store and manage data
* HashMap and HashSet in Java; dict and set in Python
