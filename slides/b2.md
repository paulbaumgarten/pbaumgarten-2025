# Lesson 1: Hello world

---

## Today's agenda: Set up our tools

1. Install Thonny or VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install Github Desktop - https://desktop.github.com/
3. Create a Github account - https://github.com/
4. Create a Github repo for your initial exercises (creating a dedicated folder as well)
5. Add me as a collaborator (user: `paulbaumgarten`)
6. Practice uploading to your Github repo

---

## Why Github?

* Practice using industry standard tooling
* Cloud-based storage. Think of it as Google Drive but for programming projects.
* Version Control. A history of all changes made to your code.
* Synchronisation with multiple computers.
* Automated tests. We can automatically run checks on the code you submit to see if it has solved the problems given.

---

## First exercise

Let's start with the classic...

```python
name = input("What is your name?")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Save as `exercise_01_hello.py`

---

## Add automated tests to your repo

* Obtain these two files from my [website](https://pbaumgarten.com/docs/ib-compsci-2027/b2.html#lesson-1-hello-world) and add to your repo:
  * `test_exercises.py`
  * `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`
* Github Desktop: Push (upload) to Github
* Github Desktop: Repository / View on Github
* Check the status of the test...

---

## Checking test results

Did your tests pass?

# Lesson 4: Exception handling & debugging techniques

---

## Syllabus

B2.1.3 Describe how programs use common exception handling techniques.

* Potential points of failure in a program must include unexpected inputs, resource unavailability, logic errors.
* The role of exception handling in developing programs

* Must include fundamental operations such as push, pop, peek and isEmpty
* How stack operations impact both performance and memory usage
* An appropriate stack for a specific problem

B2.3.2 Construct programs utilizing appropriate selection structures.

* Must include: if, else, else if (Java), elif (Python), to execute different code blocks based on specified conditions
* Selection structures with or without Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and/or relational operators (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=) to control program flow effectively

---

# Lesson 10,11: Iteration

---

## Syllabus

---

# Lesson 12: Functions & modularisation

---

## Syllabus

B2.3.4 Construct functions and modularization.

* Functions to define reusable blocks of code with different inputs
