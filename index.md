I am a Secondary Computer Science teacher, currently working at an international school in Hong Kong where I teach Computer Science through the IB Diploma, IGCSE and MYP. Previously I have also lived and worked in Lausanne Switzerland, and Perth Australia, which is where I was raised.

## Current projects

### Published textbook for IB Diploma Computer Science

In collaboration with Carl Turland and Ioana Ganea, I have authored a book for the new IB Diploma Computer Science syllabus published by [Hachette Learning (formerly Hodder Education)](https://www.hachettelearning.com/computing-and-it/computer-science-for-the-ib-diploma). It is also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Diploma-Paul-Baumgarten/dp/1036009009).

### Code Hers HK

Computer Science, as a subject and a profession, remains heavily male dominated. Code Hers is a collaboration of 11 International Schools within Hong Kong that aims to address this disparity by providing a safe, supporting and encouraging environment for girls to have a go. The ultimate aim is to normalise the presence of women in tech, making the need for such events obsolete. Until that day comes, however, events like Code Hers are critically important and serve an important role.

The inaugural event in 2024 attracted over 300 girls in attendance, and we are hoping for 500 at our 2025 event on 15 March.

### Coding Quest

Coding Quest is an annual competition specifically for secondary students to showcase their knowledge and understanding of algorithm design, data structures and computational thinking.

There are no prizes, just bragging rights. Coding Quest exists mostly for students to compete against themselves.

Coding Quest was a project I started during the Covid era, and it has gathered pace since. Last year over 100 schools had students participate!
