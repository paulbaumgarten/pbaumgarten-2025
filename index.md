# Welcome

I am a Secondary Computer Science teacher, currently working at an international school in Hong Kong where I teach Computer Science through the IB Diploma, IGCSE and MYP. Previously I have also lived and worked in Lausanne Switzerland, and Perth Australia, which is where I was raised.

## Why learn Computer Science?

*Why learn Computer Science and programming?*

Computer Science is everywhere! It is the field that is changing society like no other. From transportation to agriculture, medicine to business finance, from entertainment to government – Computer Science is rapidly changing our business and personal lives. It does not matter if you wish to pursue Computer Science for a career, or if you are just exploring it while in school, a solid background in the fundamentals of Computer Science will be valuable no matter your final profession. 

Computer Science is more than programming, and programming is more than coding. In fact, "Coding is to programming what typing is to writing. If you learn to program by learning to code, you essentially only know how to type." - Dr Leslie Lamport (Turing Award winner and Computer Science luminary).

Ultimately, Computer Science is about solving problems. It includes the study of algorithms and the structure of data to help model the problems we are working on. Programming languages are a tool used to help express our solution. While this guide is focused only on the latter, it is important to remember the bigger picture as you proceed. 

## Current projects

### Computer Science for the IB Diploma by Paul Baumgarten, Ioana Ganea, and Carl Turland

<img style="float: right; width: 100px" src="assets/ib-compsci-book.png">
**Computer Science for the IB Diploma** published by Hachette and approved by the IB. The textbook fully addresses both SL and HL content, caters to either Python or Java as the language of instruction, and includes a thorough 40 page guide to the IA filled with exemplar work from former students, top tips, common mistakes, and checklists.

The authors delivered a webinar to launch the new book and outline key features, which is available here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0SKH9EMXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0SKH9EMXM)

Order from: [Hachette](https://www.hachettelearning.com/computing-and-it/computer-science-for-the-ib-diploma) / [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Diploma-Paul-Baumgarten/dp/1036009009) / [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/computer-science-for-the-ib-diploma/carl-turland/ioana-ganea/9781036009007) / [Foyles](https://www.foyles.co.uk/book/computer-science-for-the-ib-diploma/carl-turland/9781036009007) / [The IB Bookshop](https://www.ibbookshop.co.uk/product/computer-science-for-the-ib-diploma/), and other major bookstores that cater to international schools.

The book was published on 24th April 2025 and is now available with ISBN: 9781036009007. A big thank you to my co-authors Ioana Ganea and Carl Turland - it was a lot of fun doing this project together.

### CodeHers HK

<img style="float: right; width: 200px" src="assets/codehershk.png">
Computer Science, as a subject and a profession, remains heavily male dominated. Code Hers is a collaboration of 11 International Schools within Hong Kong that aims to address this disparity by providing a safe, supporting and encouraging environment for girls to have a go. The ultimate aim is to normalise the presence of women in tech, making the need for such events obsolete. Until that day comes, however, events like Code Hers are critically important and serve an important role.

The inaugural event in 2024 attracted over 300 girls in attendance. Our 2025 event also saw over 300 girls in attendance, coming from 42 schools across all of Hong Kong.

Here is an [infographic](/assets/gender-equality-in-cs-why.png) that outlines the case for girls-only events in Computer Science.

### Coding Quest

Coding Quest is an annual competition specifically for secondary students to showcase their knowledge and understanding of algorithm design, data structures and computational thinking.

There are no prizes, just bragging rights. Coding Quest exists mostly for students to compete against themselves.

Coding Quest was a project I started during the Covid era, and it has gathered pace since. Last year over 100 schools had students participate!
